						<h2> Jack of all Trades </h2>
					</header>
					<p> Throughout my university education and work history, I have always stood on top of the center line separating Science and Technology.
						I was first exposed to C++ and Excel by my father at a young age but did not have the drive to complete projects for myself. I just understood how to think like a computer and better understand pattern recognition.
						Over time, I grew my knowledge base for languages like HTML and CSS to better understand how websites worked as I interacted with them for the sake of clarity.
						My first real experience driving through projects was as a CS major at my first university where we dabbled with Alice to visually stimulate our learning experience of Javascript. Later my first project, a black jack program, was given to us as a take home final exam.
						I did not appreciate what I was learning then nor did I realize it was my calling because from that point on I fell into the sciences. Fastforward some years and I realized what I was good at understanding, what my passion was...data. Data shapes our understanding for the world and through graphical information we are given visual context to provide clarity.
						Through this calling and my love for both the sciences and tech, I decided to finally graduate with something I could be proud of due to what it meant to me, and straddle science and technology through Geospatial Information Systems by using the Python language for ArcGIS and QGIS software. Since then I have dabbled in multiple projects, either a largescale one I did by myself or smaller projects and scripts to support my laboratory work life.
						Needless to say, this caused me to become a jack of all trades having a hand in understanding multiple languages, libraries and more. At the end of the day, I am most comfortable with Python. </p>
